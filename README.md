# i3wm_ubuntush
Here's a simple Bash script that you can use to install i3 window manager on Ubuntu:

Save this script as `install_i3.sh`. Then, make it executable by running the following command:

```bash
chmod +x install_i3.sh
```

Finally, run the script with the following command:

```bash
./install_i3.sh
```

This script will update the package list, install i3 window manager and its dependencies, install additional packages for i3, copy the default i3 configuration file to the user's home directory, and restart the display manager to load i3.
